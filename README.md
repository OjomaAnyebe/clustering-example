# A Simple Example of Clustering - Exercise

This repository contains the solution to the **"A Simple Example of Clustering"** exercise from my Udemy data science learning course. It is part of my continuous journey in mastering machine learning techniques.

## About the Exercise

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data points into meaningful clusters based on their similarity. In this exercise, I applied **K-Means clustering** to explore how data points naturally group together.

### **Objectives**
- Understand the concept of **unsupervised learning**.
- Implement **K-Means clustering** from scratch.
- Visualize clustered data points.

---

## **Dataset Details**
- The dataset contains **two numerical features**, making it ideal for 2D visualization.
- It represents an **artificial dataset**, commonly used to illustrate clustering algorithms.
- No labeled output (unsupervised learning).

---

## **Tools and Libraries Used**
- **Python**
- **NumPy** - For numerical operations.
- **Pandas** - For data handling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - For visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** - For implementing K-Means clustering.

---

## **Key Steps in the Notebook**
1. **Load and Explore Data**:
   - Inspect dataset structure.
   - Visualize raw data distribution.
   
2. **Apply K-Means Clustering**:
   - Choose the number of clusters **(K)**.
   - Train the K-Means model.

4. **Visualize Clusters**:
   - Plot data points and assigned cluster labels.
   - Analyze the separation of clusters.

## **Results & Learning Reflection**
- Successfully implemented K-Means clustering.
- Understood the impact of **K selection** on clustering quality.
- Gained insights into **unsupervised learning** techniques.
